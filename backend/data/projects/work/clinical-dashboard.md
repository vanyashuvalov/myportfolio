## Project Overview

The Clinical Dashboard project aimed to revolutionize how healthcare facilities manage surgery block scheduling. Clinical workers were struggling with outdated systems that led to inefficient block time allocation, scheduling conflicts, and poor resource utilization.

::: callout info
💡 **Impact**: Deployed across 2,600+ care sites, serving 50,000+ clinical workers daily
:::

## The Challenge

Healthcare facilities faced several critical issues:

- **Complex Scheduling**: Multiple surgeons, operating rooms, and time blocks created scheduling nightmares
- **Data Overload**: Clinical workers needed to process vast amounts of scheduling data quickly
- **Time-Critical Decisions**: Surgery scheduling requires real-time decision making
- **Compliance Requirements**: Healthcare regulations added complexity to the workflow

## Research & Discovery

### User Interviews

I conducted 15+ interviews with clinical schedulers, surgeons, and OR managers to understand their pain points:

::: quote Clinical Scheduler, Major Hospital
I spend 3 hours every morning just trying to figure out which blocks are available and who needs them most. It's exhausting and error-prone.
:::

### Key Insights

::: stats
- **15+** user interviews conducted
- **3 hours** daily spent on scheduling
- **40%** of blocks underutilized
- **25+** scheduling conflicts per week
:::

1. **Visual Priority**: Users needed to see availability at a glance
2. **Quick Actions**: Most common tasks should be one-click operations
3. **Context Awareness**: System should understand urgency and priority
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Proactive warnings before scheduling conflicts occur

## Design Solution

### Information Architecture

I redesigned the information hierarchy to prioritize:

- Real-time block availability visualization
- Surgeon schedules and preferences
- Operating room capacity and equipment
- Patient priority levels

### Visual Design System

Created a comprehensive design system featuring:

- **Color-coded Priority Levels**: Red (urgent), Orange (high), Yellow (medium), Green (routine)
- **Timeline Visualization**: Horizontal timeline showing block allocation across days/weeks
- **Capacity Indicators**: Visual gauges showing OR utilization
- **Quick Action Buttons**: One-click scheduling, swapping, and cancellation

### Key Features

#### 1. Smart Block Allocation

The dashboard uses intelligent algorithms to suggest optimal block assignments based on:

- Surgeon preferences and historical patterns
- Patient priority and wait times
- OR availability and equipment requirements
- Staff scheduling and expertise

#### 2. Conflict Detection

Real-time conflict detection prevents scheduling errors:

- Overlapping surgeon schedules
- Equipment availability conflicts
- Staff shortage warnings
- Compliance violation alerts

#### 3. Drag-and-Drop Scheduling

Intuitive drag-and-drop interface allows schedulers to:

- Move blocks between time slots
- Swap surgeon assignments
- Adjust block durations
- Reschedule with automatic conflict checking

## Implementation

### Prototyping Process

1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**: Sketched initial concepts with clinical staff
2. **Interactive Prototypes**: Built clickable prototypes in Figma
3. **Usability Testing**: Conducted 5 rounds of testing with 20+ users
4. **Iteration**: Refined design based on feedback

### Technical Collaboration

Worked closely with engineering team to ensure:

- Real-time data synchronization
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile responsiveness for on-the-go access

## Results & Impact

### Quantitative Metrics

::: metrics
- Scheduling Time: 3 hours → 50 minutes (-70%)
- Scheduling Conflicts: 25/week → 4/week (-85%)
- OR Utilization: 60% → 84% (+40%)
- User Satisfaction: 60% → 95% (+35%)
:::

### Qualitative Feedback

::: quote OR Manager, Partner Hospital
This dashboard has transformed how we work. What used to take hours now takes minutes, and we make better decisions with less stress.
:::

### Business Impact

::: stats
- **2,600+** care sites deployed
- **50,000+** clinical workers daily
- **1M+** surgery blocks annually
- **Best Healthcare UX** at 2024 Design Awards
:::

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Deep User Research**: Spending time with actual users in their environment was invaluable
2. **Iterative Design**: Multiple rounds of testing caught issues early
3. **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Close partnership with engineering ensured feasibility

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Complexity Management**: Simplified complex workflows without losing functionality
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Balanced needs of schedulers, surgeons, and administrators
3. **Technical Constraints**: Worked within existing healthcare IT infrastructure

### Future Improvements

- AI-powered scheduling recommendations
- Predictive analytics for capacity planning
- Mobile app for surgeons
- Integration with electronic health records (EHR)

## Design Process

### Tools & Methods

- **Research**: User interviews, contextual inquiry, journey mapping
- **Design**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite
- **Prototyping**: Figma interactive prototypes, InVision
- **Testing**: UserTesting.com, in-person usability sessions
- **Collaboration**: Miro, Slack, Jira

### Timeline

::: metrics
- Research & Discovery: 4 weeks
- Design & Prototyping: 8 weeks
- Testing & Iteration: 6 weeks
- Implementation Support: 12 weeks
- Total Duration: 7 months
:::

## Conclusion

The Clinical Dashboard project demonstrates how thoughtful UX design can solve complex healthcare challenges. By focusing on user needs, iterating based on feedback, and collaborating closely with stakeholders, we created a solution that significantly improved clinical workflows and patient care.
