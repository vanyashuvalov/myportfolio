## Project Overview

The FinTech Mobile Banking App project aimed to create a modern, user-friendly banking experience tailored specifically for Gen Z users (ages 18-25). The challenge was to make financial management intuitive, engaging, and educational without overwhelming young users with complex banking jargon.

::: callout info
💡 **Mission**: Make banking accessible and engaging for Gen Z without sacrificing security or functionality
:::

## The Challenge

Traditional banking apps were failing to engage younger users:

- **Complex Navigation**: Too many features buried in confusing menus
- **Intimidating Terminology**: Banking jargon that alienated young users
- **Poor Money Management**: No clear visibility into spending patterns
- **Lack of Education**: No guidance on building healthy financial habits

## Research & Discovery

### User Interviews

Conducted 25+ interviews with Gen Z users to understand their banking pain points:

::: quote College Student, Age 21
I avoid checking my bank app because it makes me anxious. I just want to know if I can afford something without doing math.
:::

### Key Insights

::: stats
- **25+** user interviews conducted
- **73%** felt anxious about banking apps
- **89%** wanted visual spending insights
- **92%** interested in savings goals
:::

1. **Visual First**: Users wanted to see their financial health at a glance
2. **Contextual Help**: Needed explanations without leaving the flow
3. **Goal-Oriented**: Wanted to save for specific things, not abstract amounts
4. **Social Proof**: Trusted peer recommendations over bank marketing

## Design Solution

### Information Architecture

Redesigned the app structure around user goals:

- Quick balance check on home screen
- Visual spending breakdown by category
- Goal-based savings with progress tracking
- Educational content integrated contextually

### Visual Design System

Created a fresh, approachable design system:

- **Vibrant Colors**: Purple primary, gradient accents
- **Friendly Illustrations**: Custom icons and empty states
- **Clear Typography**: Large, readable text with hierarchy
- **Micro-interactions**: Delightful animations for key actions

### Key Features

#### 1. Smart Home Screen

The home screen shows everything users need at a glance:

- Video tutorials from financial experts
- Gamified learning with rewards

## Implementation

### Prototyping Process

1. **Sketches**: Rapid ideation with users
2. **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity flows for testing
3. **High-Fidelity Mockups**: Pixel-perfect designs in Figma
4. **Interactive Prototype**: Fully clickable prototype for user testing
5. **Design System**: Comprehensive component library

### Technical Collaboration

Worked with iOS and Android teams to ensure:

- Native platform patterns (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)
