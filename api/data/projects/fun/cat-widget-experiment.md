## Project Overview

An experimental desktop widget that brings a virtual pet cat to your workspace. The cat responds to interactions, walks around, and can be fed treats.

::: callout info
This was a weekend project to explore canvas animations and state machines in vanilla JavaScript.
:::

## Features

- **Animated States**: Idle, walking, eating, and happy animations
- **Interactive**: Click to feed, drag to move
- **Personality**: Random behaviors and reactions
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and sprite-based animations

## Technical Implementation

Built with vanilla JavaScript using:
- Canvas API for rendering
- State machine pattern for behavior
- Event-driven architecture
- SVG sprite animations

::: stats
- **100%** vanilla JavaScript
- **0** dependencies
- **5** animation states

## What I Learned

This project taught me about:
- State management without frameworks
- Performance optimization for animations
- Creating engaging micro-interactions
- Building reusable widget systems

## Future Ideas

- Add more pet types (dog, hamster)
- Implement mood system
- Add mini-games
- Create widget marketplace
